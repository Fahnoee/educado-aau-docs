# Development Workflow

This section covers the development workflow, task management, and GitHub practices for the Educado project.

## Task Management

### Trello Board Usage

Use the Trello link provided in the project links for task management.

**Task Workflow:**
1. When starting a task, drag it to the correct category
2. Assign responsible team members
3. Add brief description of required work
4. Label tasks as: `feature`, `bug`, or `chore`
5. Move to "Done" only when PR is merged

⚠️ **Important**: If you discover potential fixes or bugs, create a bug/chore task in Trello and place it in the "Awaiting" category.

## Branch Management

### Branch Naming Convention

Branches must follow these naming patterns:

- `feature/name-of-feature` - For adding new features
- `bug/name-of-bug` - For fixing existing broken code  
- `chore/name-of-chore` - For changes like adding comments or optimizing features

### Example Branch Names
- `feature/user-authentication`
- `bug/navbar-scroll-issue` 
- `chore/add-code-comments`
