# Backend Development

## Overview

The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, following scalable architecture patterns for future team collaboration and LMS integration.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** - Popular, scalable, and easy to learn language choice
- **Node.js + Express** - Scalable, learnable framework matching IWP curriculum
- **Mongoose (MongoDB)** - Fits requirements, scalable for the use case, easy setup with third-party hosting
- **ESLint** - Development tool for code formatting and alignment

## Architecture Philosophy

The backend follows **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** folder structure for maintainability and scalability.

### Key Principles

✅ **Use `const` instead of `var`**  
✅ **Scalable backend design** - Future teams will work on this codebase  
✅ **Easy LMS integration** - Architecture supports external learning management systems

## Getting Started

Review the file structure and understand the MVC pattern before implementing new features. Each component (models, routes, utilities) has specific responsibilities and organizational patterns.
